This repository contains digital files, scripts, tools, and documentation developed for a summer research project using the **OpenBCI Ultracortex Mark IV** EEG headset.  
The project forms part of a wider study investigating EEG activity during driving simulation tasks.

## Overview

The research group is working with a full driving simulator setup and an OpenBCI EEG system.  
My role in the project focuses on the **hardware and software engineering** required to integrate the EEG headset into a clean, reliable data-collection workflow.

This repository gathers all digital artefacts created during this work, including code, reference material, and prototype tooling.

## Project Goals

- Assemble and validate the **Ultracortex Mark IV** EEG headset  
- Integrate EEG acquisition into the experiment pipeline using **Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)**
- Develop Python tools for recording, receiving, and inspecting EEG streams  
- Create scripts to streamline event markers and synchronisation  
- Prototype a **digital resistance box** to validate electrode impedance measurements  
- Support noise reduction, troubleshooting, and technical documentation

## Repository Contents

The repo will include:

- **Python scripts** for:
  - LSL data streaming and recording  
  - Event marker injection  
  - Data inspection (e.g., XDF utilities)
- **Prototype hardware files** (e.g., Arduino sketches, circuit notes)
- **Documentation** related to workflow setup and troubleshooting
- **Figures, diagrams, or poster assets** for reporting
- **Notes and drafts** relevant to EEG data handling

As the project progresses, new tools and results will be added.

## Status

This repository is actively updated throughout the summer project.  
Many tools are in early prototype stages and may change as the experimental workflow develops.
